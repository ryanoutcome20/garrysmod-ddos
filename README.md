## Usage
Basic usage is fairly simple, the script needs to be executed through menustate and ran on your client. Optionally you can just edit the menustate files themselves to get the same result since you don't need to be connected to a server to execute anything. After executing the script simply run the console command to initiate an attack.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Command syntax is `ddos ip count` in console!

## Contribution
Unfortunately I don't see this as a project I'm gonna keep up for long at all. It's a very simple script I made in a few minutes to test if it was even possible. If you make any issues or pull-requests then I'll see what I can do to help you.
